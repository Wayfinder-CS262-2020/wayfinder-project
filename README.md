# About
This is the Wayfinder Project for CS262 Team E 2020.

We plan to implement a fully realized map app for Calvin University to help students get to their classes.

To be able to run this project, you'll have to install the dependancies and libraries with npm using `npm install`.

# Vision Statement
Many students, especially freshmen, suffer from getting lost inside the numerous buildings on campus. Due to this disorientation, these students' performance in class can suffer, which may even lead to them dropping out of college. Our new technology, named **Wayfinder**, aims to fix that by providing indoor directions as well as outdoor coverage. Other mapping applications like Google Maps don't offer these indoor directions, making Wayfinder unique. With fully laid-out floor plans for every building, this app will guide you to your destination no matter how strange your class locations might be. It isn't limited to just classes, either; Wayfinder can guide you to services like Campus Safety, the Career Center, Counseling and Wellness, and your professor's office.

Wayfinder will be a mobile application capable of running on most devices, making it easily accessible to students. Guests and parents will also be free to use the app, although for security reasons the features of the app will be limited, requiring a student login to access the full functionality. The app will have an intuitive and simple UI, requiring only a few typed inputs to guide you to your destination. The guiding itself will take place on an interactive map within the application, with lines and arrows drawn on the map to lead you wherever you need to go.
