# About
This is the Wayfinder Project for CS262 Team E 2020.

# Vision Statement
Many students, especially freshmen, suffer from getting lost on campus or inside its numerous buildings. Due to this geographic disorientation, these students' performance in class can suffer, and their experience at college will be negatively impacted as a result. Our application, named **Wayfinder**, aims to fix that by providing indoor directions as well as outdoor coverage. Other mapping applications like Google Maps don't offer these indoor directions, making Wayfinder unique. With fully laid-out floor plans for every building, this app will guide you to your destination no matter how strange your class locations might be. It isn't limited to just classes, either; Wayfinder can guide you to services like Campus Safety, the Career Center, Counseling and Wellness, and your professor's office.

Wayfinder will be a mobile application capable of running on most devices, making it easily accessible to students. Guests and parents will also be free to use the app, although for security reasons the features of the app will be limited, requiring a student login to access the full functionality. These limited features will offer outdoor guidance, including guidance to buildings or outdoor events, but will not offer indoor coverage. To guide you to a classroom, the app will require only the name of the building and the number of the classroom, promptly displaying a route once that information is provided. For outdoor areas, you only need to input the name of the gathering point, e.g. "Commons Lawn". The guiding itself will take place on an interactive map within the application, with lines and arrows drawn on the map to lead you wherever you need to go.
